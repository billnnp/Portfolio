			<h1>4 Easy Steps to Satay Perfection!</h1>
			<ul id="steps">
				<dt><span>1. Make the marinade.</span> Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar,
					curry powder, ground coriander, ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.
				</dt>

				<dt><span>2. Marinate the chicken.</span> Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts
					to the marinade, toss the chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the
					refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes. This chicken is honestly so flavorful and tender after
					just a 30 minute marinade, but if you want to make it earlier, you can leave the chicken in the
					marinade for up to 4 hours.</dt>

				<dt><span>3. Skewer the chicken.</span> If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30
					minutes before preparing the skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the
					grill, pretty important stuff! Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinating
					liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces of marinated chicken onto skewers. You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or
					soaked wooden skewers.</dt>

				<dt><span>4. Grill the chicken.</span> Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly
					over high heat will give them a wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and
					tender in the middle! Place the skewers on the grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and
					grill for an additional 3-4 minutes. Remove from the grill and top with fresh cilantro, if you’d
					like.</dt>

			<h1>What should I serve with it?</h1>
			<div id="eatwith">
				<h3>Thai Peanut Sauce</h3>
				<p>while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find
					chicken satay paired with peanut sauce. They really are a match made in heaven!</p>
				<h3>Lettuce Leaves</h3>
				<p>chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a
					fork to remove the chicken from the skewers and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine
					lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a little peanut sauce and you’ve got a light, healthy meal!</p>
				<h3>Fresh Veggies</h3>
				<p>as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh
					veggie tray from Vons and extra Thai peanut sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and
					veggie combo was light, yet still filling enough for a meal and it gave me the opportunity to
					dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut sauce!</p>
				<h3>Stir Fried Veggies</h3>
				<p>while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to
					stir fry up your favorite veggies, like broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.</p>
				<h3>Asian Salad</h3>
				<p>for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce
					section at your local Vons, to pair with the chicken skewers.</p>
				<h3>Cooked Rice or Quinoa</h3>
				<p>for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay with a
					side of cooked white rice, brown rice or quinoa.</p>
